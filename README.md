# Manifolds-in-Data-Science

How do I spatially represent my data in an accurate and meaningful way? 

Manifolds describe a vast number of geometric surfaces. To be a manifold, there’s one important rule that needs to be satisfied. The best way to understand this property is through example. Manifolds exist in any dimension, but for the sake of simplicity, let’s think about a three-dimensional space.

Suppose there is a small ant walking along a manifold in three dimensions. This manifold could be curvy, twisty, or even have holes in it. Now here’s the rule: From the point of view of the ant, everywhere it walks should look like a flat plane.

If you’re looking for an application I think this is one that all of us can relate to; we live on a manifold! A sphere is one of the simplest examples of a manifold in three dimensions.
